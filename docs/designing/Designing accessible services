At Hackney Counci we want to make our services as accessibile as possible for as many people as possible. Whether the service is for our residents or members of staff.

Designing for accessibility is an important part of the process.

The Government Home Office has developed guidance on how to design more accessible services. The guidance covers best design practices for users who may have low vision, D/deaf and hard of hearing, dyslexia, motor disabilities, users on the autistic spectrum and users of screen readers.

Following these design practices will help us acheive our aim of having accessible services.
