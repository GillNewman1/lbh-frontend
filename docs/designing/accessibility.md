At Hackney Council we want our services to be as accessible as possible for everyone.

The Government Home Office has some guidance on how to design more accessible services. 

The guidance covers design best practices for users from these areas: low vision, D/deaf and hard of hearing, dyslexia, motor disabilities, users on the autistic spectrum and users of screen readers.
