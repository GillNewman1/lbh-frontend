Our Figma design kit is a work in progress and ever evolving, but you can use it as a starting point for your designs.

For new projects, you should use Figma over other design tools like Sketch, because it's easier for us to work together.

To join our Figma team or for help using this kit, post on [#hackit-design-system](https://hackit-lbh.slack.com/archives/CJ6AWTH0A) or email [Joy Suthigoseeya](mailto:joy.suthigoseeya@hackney.gov.uk).

To contribute components or patterns to these kits, see our [contributor guidance](/contributing/introduction).
