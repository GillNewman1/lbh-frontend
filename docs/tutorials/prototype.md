## Use the Codepen

**[See the codepen here](https://codepen.io/jhackett1/pen/xxRWWKv)**

The fastest way to experiment with the Hackney design system is with Codepen.

You can paste code samples straight into the HTML tab, without installing anything.

If you want to keep your pen, you can fork it.

## Use a CodeSandbox

Because Codepen doesn't support multiple pages or a file system, there are things you won't be able to do with it.

For anything more complicated, you can use the [simple frontend repo](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/lbh-simple-frontend).

You can use CodeSandbox to build prototypes using the kit without downloading anything to your computer.
