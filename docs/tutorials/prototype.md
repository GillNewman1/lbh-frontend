## Use our CodePen template

The fastest way to experiment with the Hackney design system is with **[our CodePen template](https://codepen.io/jhackett1/pen/xxRWWKv)**. You can paste code samples straight into the HTML tab, without installing anything.

You can save your work to your CodePen account and share it with colleagues.

## Use the prototyping kit

CodePen doesn't support multiple pages or assets, so it's only suitable for quick experiments. If you need more, you can use **[our prototype kit](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/lbh-simple-frontend)**.

You can use the prototyping kit right away with CodeSandbox, or you can install it to your computer like you would the GOV.UK prototype kit.
