## Use our CodePen template

The fastest way to experiment with the Hackney design system is with our CodePen template. You can paste code samples straight into the HTML tab, without installing anything.

You can save your work to your CodePen account and share it with colleagues.

## Use the prototyping kit

CodePen doesn't support multiple pages or assets, so it's only suitable for quick experiments. If you need more, you can use our [prototype kit](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/lbh-simple-frontend).

### 1. On CodeSandbox

You can use CodeSandbox to build prototypes using the kit without downloading anything to your computer.

### 2. Install it to your computer
