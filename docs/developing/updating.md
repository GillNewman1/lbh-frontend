title: Update using npm
---

You should occasionally update your version of the design system to benefit from new components, bug fixes and other improvements.

See our [release notes](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/lbh-frontend/releases) for what's new in each version.

To get the latest version, run:

```
npm install lbh-frontend@latest
```

Most changes are purely presentational, so even if your tests pass it's a good idea to visually inspect your app to make sure it looks like you expect.
