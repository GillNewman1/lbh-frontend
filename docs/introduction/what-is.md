title: What is Hackney Design System?
slug: /
---

The Hackney Design System is our open-source foundation for building Hackney platforms and services.

It consists of working code examples you can use in prototypes or production, as well as design kits you can experiment with.

It's based on [GOV.UK Frontend](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk) and the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk). All the components and tools of those systems are adapted here.
