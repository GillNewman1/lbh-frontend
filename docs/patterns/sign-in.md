title: Sign in to a service

:::note
This pattern is intended for staff-facing use only.
:::

Most services intended for council officers will require users to log in with their Hackney Google account.

We use a page like this to explain that:

![Sign in screen example](/img/sign-in.png)

For consistency, use "sign in" and "sign out" rather than "log in" and "log out".

You should customise the content below the button with guidance specific to your service.
