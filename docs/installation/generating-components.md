# Generating components

To generate HTML for a component if you're not using nunjucks you've got a couple of options:

- Go to the component page and look for the most similar example, copy the code (expand the code link and copy the "Markup" section) and replace the bits that need replacing with your customisation...

- ...OR go to the component page, scroll down to the bottom of the page and expand the "Create HTML" form. Fill in the form fields that you require with your relevant values and let the HTML be generated for you.

## Create HTML

The Create HTML form let's you create completely bespoke elements, but the number of options might feel overwhelming. In the most case you can ignore most of the options and only fill in the required fields. In particular options such as "Classes" and "Attributes" provide flexibility for developers but are never required to be populated.
